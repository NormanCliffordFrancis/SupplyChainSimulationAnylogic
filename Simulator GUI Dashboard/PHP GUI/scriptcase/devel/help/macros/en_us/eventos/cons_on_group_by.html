<p class="corpo1">This event it is executed inside the grouping., independent of the grouping level,&nbsp;this event&nbsp;allows the manipulation of the sumarizated fields. <br /><br />The Scriptcase&nbsp;makes available all the sumarizated variables. Assuming an application that has two levels of grouping (<strong>state and city</strong>) and that sums two fields (<strong>parcel and balance</strong>), we can have access to the totals, in the scope of "calculate to each register", of the following way: <br /><br /><br />- contains the total amount of the registers; <br />{sum_parcel}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - contains the general summing of the "parcel" field; <br />{sum_balance}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - contains the general summing of the "balance" field;<br />{count_state}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - contains the total amount of the registers, of "state" grouping that is being processed; <br />{sum_state_parcel}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - contains the summing of the "parcel" field, of the "state" grouping that is being processed; <br />{sum_state_balance}&nbsp;&nbsp; - contains the summing of the "balance" field, of the "state" grouping that is being processed; <br />{count_city}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - contains the total amount of the registers, of the "city" grouping that is being processed;<br />{sum_city_parcel} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; - contains the summing of the "parcel" field, of the "city" grouping that is being processed; <br />{sum_city_balance} &nbsp; &nbsp; - contains the summing of the "balance" field, of the "city" grouping that is being processed; <br /><br /><br />Considering that the formulas, defined to be processed in the scope of "calculate during the groupings" will be acting for the various grouping levels, the special sum variables, in this scope, are referenced substituting the grouping name by the word key "grouping", or either: <br /><br />{count_ger}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - contains the total amount of the registers; <br />{sum_parcel}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - contains the general summing of the "parcel" field;<br />{sum_balance}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - contains the general summing of the "balance" field;<br />{count_grouping}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - contains the total amount of the registers, of the grouping that is being processed; <br />{sum_grouping_parcel}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - contains the summing of the "parcel" field, of the grouping is being processed;<br />{sum_grouping_balance}&nbsp; - contains the summing of the "balance" field, of the grouping is being processed;<br /><span class="corpo1">&nbsp;</span></p>
