<H1>EVENTS</H1>
<p>In ScriptCase was incorporated the concept of
Events in the applications, making possible a more standard
development. It was also created a
documentation system in the ScriptCase to display the ScriptCase
macros that have reference to each selected event.</P>
<p><STRONG>onScriptInit - </STRONG>This
event is executed once, before the execution of the main
select of the application. In this scope, normally, are executed the
macros that modify the select, such as: sc_select_field,
sc_select_order, sc_select_where(add) and etc.</P>
<p><STRONG>onRefresh -</STRONG> <SPAN>Occurs   when the application is loaded. </SPAN> </P>
<p><STRONG><B>onValidate -</B></STRONG> <SPAN>Occurs   when a validation is performed.</SPAN> </P>
<p><STRONG>onSave -</STRONG> <SPAN>Occurs   when the application is saved. </SPAN></P>
