<h1>EVENTS</h1>
 <p><span>Scriptcase uses the concept of events to enable to developer to customize application code. Events allow the developer to define custom actions at a specific execution time (e.g. After a record is inserted, when it is loaded, upon submitting a form, ...) and for a specific type of application.</span></p>

<p><b>OnInit</b>- This event is executed just one
  time, before the main select of the application execution. In this scope,
  normally, are executed the macros that update the select, as these: sc_select_field, sc_select_order,sc_select_<span>where(add) and etc.</span>
<p><b>onRecord</b>- This event is executed before displaying each grid record.</p>
<p><b>onHeader</b>- This event is executed immediately before displaying the grid header. Use this event to print some calculated value in the header for example.</p>
<p><b>onFooter</b>-Used to display some
  calculated value. Write in this event the necessary calculation to display the result in the footer.</p>
  
<p>Any event can use pre-defined functions (macros) that are available in and specific to Scriptcase. These functions are called "Scriptcase Macros". </p>
