<h1> Sorting</h1>

<p><span> Define the sorting of the fields. The application
fields   are sorted at running time, just by clicking on the column  name (field)
 to order it. By default breaks are respected in the
fields sort. Also by default, the six first fields already come
checked (with an asterisk at the field left side).</span></p>
