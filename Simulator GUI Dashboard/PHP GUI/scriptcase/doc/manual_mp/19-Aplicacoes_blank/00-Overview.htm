<h1>Overview </h1>
<p>This type of application allows the developer to write  PHP / HTML  code and display a process  result. A good example of its use is  called the batch process, the advantage of using this application  instead of creating a .php program manually outside the ScriptCase is  the possibility of using ScriptCase macros  well as native integration  with control access to their systems.</p>
