<h1>Joins Definition</h1>
<p> Use this tab to create <em>join </em>commands with SQL tables selected on <em>Tables </em>tab. <br>
It can be acccessed after set the definitions in the Fields Tab.</p>
<p>An example of <em>join </em>use would be the following: In a table of customers register T1 there is the &quot;Customer Code&quot; field. In a Purchase Order T2 table also there is the &quot;Customer Code&quot; field and the purchase orders of the customers. If we are making a <em>join</em> of the tables CadClientes and CadPedVendas, we will use a commom field (&quot;Customer Code&quot;) and we will have as result a cartesian product of these two tables in accordance with the kind of defined <em>join</em> (equal to, bigger than, smaller than...). In other words, they will be joined and the data ordered in accordance with the kind of defined <em>join</em>.</p>

<p>The window initially presents two lines of fields for <em>joins </em>realization. Each field contains the list of the table fields selected. If the two lines are fulfilled, clicking on the <strong>Confirm</strong> button, will be opened more two fields, therefore the <em>SQL Buider </em>undrestand that the user wishes to make more <em>joins</em>. If not, the user can leave the folder, therefore the commands were already incorporated in the main command that is being mounted. To being make a <em>join</em> the <em>check box </em> on the left of the field line is automatically fulfilled. </p>
