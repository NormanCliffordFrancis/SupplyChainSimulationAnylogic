<H1>EVENTS</H1>

      <p><span>Scriptcase uses the concept of events to enable to developer to customize application code. Events allow the developer to define custom actions at a specific execution time (e.g. After a record is inserted, when it is loaded, upon submitting a form, ...) and for a specific type of application.</span></p>


     <ul>
       <li><span><strong>onApplicationInit</strong> - This event runs when the application is loading just for the first time.</span></li>
	   <li><span><strong>onNavigate</strong> - This event runs when navigating from one record to another one.</span></li>
	   <li><span><strong>onScriptInit</strong> - This event runs when the application is loading.</span></li>
       <li><span><strong>onRefresh</strong> - This event runs to reload the page of the application.</span></li>
       <li><span><strong>onLoadRecord</strong> - This event occurs when the page is loaded before printing each record.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>onValidate</strong> - This event runs by clicking on the validation (OK, Update, Insert, Delete, Filter) depending on application.&nbsp;</span></li>
       <li><span><strong>onValidateFailure</strong> - This event runs if the validation is failured. With errors.</span></li>
       <li><span><strong>onValidateSuccess</strong> - This event runs if the validation is successfully. Without errors.</span></li>
       <li><span><strong>onBeforeInsert</strong> - This event runs before  insert a record.</span></li>
       <li><span><strong>onAfterInsert</strong> - This event runs after  insert a record.</span></li>
       <li><span><strong>onBeforeUpdate</strong> - This event runs before updating a record.</li>
       <li><span><strong>onAfterUpdate</strong> - This event runs after updating a record.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>onBeforeInsertAll</strong> - This event runs before inserting any record.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>onAfterInsertAll</strong> - This event runs after inserting all records.</span></li>
     <li><span><strong>onBeforeDelete</strong> - This event is executed before the deletion.</span></li>
       <li><span><strong>onAfterDelete</strong> - This event runs after the deletion.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>onBeforeUpdateAll</strong> - This event runs before updating all records.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>onAterUpdateAll</strong> - This event runs after updating all records.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>onBeforeDeleteAll</strong> - This event is executed before the removal of all records.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>onAfterDeleteAll</strong> - This event runs after the elimination of all records.</span></li>
       <li><span><strong>onLoad</strong> - This event occurs when the page is loaded, ie when navigating from one record to another one, clicking on the buttons (new, insert, etc. earlier.).</span> </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
