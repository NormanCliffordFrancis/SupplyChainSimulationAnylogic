<p>Using the definition of blocks, a page is a container
of blocks. Where in each application it is created a page which has
default name &ldquo;<B>pag1&rdquo;</B><SPAN>.
In applications of form, control and filter it is possible to create
more pages to an application. The pages are show in the application
in tabs mode, where each tab has the blocks defined in </SPAN><B>Organization
of Blocks.</B></P>

  PAGES</SPAN></STRONG></h2>
<p><BR>
The form application already bring a standard
page, identified by pag1, that can be renamed, with the creation of
new pages. The use of pages is very indicated when we have an
application that involves a lot of fields of a table (more than 20
for example). A form with more than 20 fields in the vertical would
be difficult to use.</P>
<p>An application can have a lot of pages, and in each
of them, you can include a lot of blocks.</P>
